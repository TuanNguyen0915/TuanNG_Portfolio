<h2>I'm a full-stack software engineer who enjoys building apps for accessible and intuitive design to give the customer the best and simplest way solutions. Carefulness and responsibility are two skills I learned while working in my previous career, which helped me approach SWE more easily, and work more efficiently. I am interested in technology and techniques in the full-stack development field to keep my passion for it.</h2>
